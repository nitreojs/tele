# features

every tele patch, grouped by the settings page that holds its switch. [releases](releases.md) has the same rows by the release that brought them.

everything tele adds lives in settings → tele, right below the language row, grouped into pages. the search at the top of the page, and the main settings search, find every tele setting. right-click any of them to copy a link that opens it.

backup exports your tele settings to a file you can give to anyone, and imports one with a preview of what changes. it covers tele's switches and lists, not telegram's own settings (like interface scale) or data kept per account (local pins, pinned sets, bookmarks, local folders). to move everything to another folder or pc, copy the whole `tdata` folder next to tele.

"toggle" is where the switch is and its default. `always on` has no switch, `with N` follows the switch of patch N.

more about some of them: [title bar template](title-template.md), [link cleaner](link-cleaner.md), [launch flags](launch-flags.md), [tele server](server.md).
