# releasing

for maintainers. releases are built and published by github actions and need the repository's secrets, so contributors never release anything themselves. this page explains how it works, so everyone knows what a release is made of and how to check one.

## versions

- a release is tagged `<UPSTREAM>-tele.<N>`, for example `v7.2.9-tele.10`, and titled `tele N · <upstream tag>`.
- `N` is one above the highest existing release or tag, whatever upstream it was built on: numbers go on across upstream bumps (`v7.2.9-tele.18` is followed by `v7.3.0-tele.19`), because the app compares build numbers. build.yml picks it, or takes the `number` input when it's above every existing one.
- `N` is compiled in as `TELE_BUILD`. the app shows it as `tele #N` in the title bar and `build #N` in the main menu.
- the self-updater orders builds by upstream `AppVersion` first and `N` second, so a release on a newer upstream tag always wins.

## branches

- work lands on `next`. pull requests go there.
- `main` is what gets released: a push to `main` that touches `UPSTREAM`, `patches/`, `tele.py`, `ci/` or `build.yml` starts a build that publishes each platform as soon as it's built (see [staged releases](#staged-releases)).

## before a release

1. **fold.** follow-up fixes and improvements of a feature are folded into the feature's patch where the result is the same tree, so the queue keeps one patch per feature. anything that can't be folded cleanly stays its own patch.
2. **baseline.** after a fold, record the previous release folded the same way in `ci/baselines.json`: its tag mapped to `{subject: sha256 of the changed lines}` of each patch. the release notes then compare like with like, and folded patches don't show up as dropped. the next release doesn't need it any more.
3. **patch rows.** every new patch has its row in `docs/releases.md`, every `with N` points at the right number, and the patch count at the top is right. `docs/features.md` is regenerated from it with `python ci/features.py`.
4. **dry run.** the exported queue applies to a fresh clone of the `UPSTREAM` tag with `python tele.py --tdesktop <clean clone> apply`.
5. **test.** the new and changed features were exercised in a local build. a ci run takes hours, and a broken release reaches every user through the updater.

## building and publishing

a release is built once and published from that finished build, so what was tested in ci is exactly what ships:

1. start build.yml on the branch with `publish=false`. it builds windows, linux and macos and keeps the files as artifacts for one day.
2. once it succeeds, move `main` to the same commit without starting a second build (a push to `main` normally starts one), and publish that run:

   ```
   gh workflow run build.yml --ref main -f from_run=<run id> -f publish=true
   ```

   the publishing run checks that the finished run succeeded and built the same `UPSTREAM`, `patches/` and `tele.py` as `main`, and uses the release number that run picked. all three platforms are already built, so they go out within a minute of each other.

promote.yml can do step 2 on its own: when the repository variable `PROMOTE_RUN` holds a run id, the publish starts as soon as that run succeeds.

only a run that built all three platforms can be published. a run with `publish=false` or a `platforms` subset never publishes anything, and `from_run` refuses a run whose artifacts of any platform are missing or expired, before anything goes out.

## staged releases

a release goes out one platform at a time. each platform has its own publish job that starts as soon as that platform is built, so windows users don't wait for the much longer macos build:

1. the first platform to be published creates the release with a short text (`tele N is rolling out. ready: windows. still building: linux, macos.`), `tele-changelog.json` and, for the platforms that aren't built yet, **placeholder feeds**: copies of the previous release's `tele-update-<platform>.json`. those are signed and point at the previous release's zips, so clients of a platform that isn't out yet keep seeing "up to date" instead of a missing feed. the release becomes the latest only once every feed is in place.
2. every platform then adds its files and its real signed feed, which replaces the placeholder. two platforms can finish at the same moment: placeholders are only uploaded where no feed exists, real feeds always overwrite, so a placeholder never replaces a real feed, whatever the order. the short text is updated each time.
3. when all three are published, the `announce` job writes the full release notes, closes the `build-failure` and `new-upstream` issues and posts the announcement in the telegram channel. the notes and the announcement compare with the previous release, which is picked when the run starts, before this release exists.

when a platform fails, the others stay published and its clients keep the previous release through the placeholder. the failure opens a `build-failure` issue and sends a notification. re-running the failed jobs (within a day, while the artifacts last) builds and publishes the missing platform, and then announces the release.

## what gets published

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `tele-<tag>-win64.zip` | `tele.exe` |
| `tele-<tag>-linux64.zip` | the `tele` binary |
| `tele-<tag>-macos.zip` | `tele.app`, signed ad hoc, used by the updater |
| `tele-<tag>-macos.dmg` | the same app for manual installs |
| `tele-update-win64.json`, `tele-update-linux64.json`, `tele-update-macos.json` | the signed update feeds (while a platform is still building, the previous release's) |
| `tele-changelog.json` | what's new, for the in-app chat |

once every platform is out, the release notes list the new, changed and dropped patches with their rows from `docs/releases.md`, the downloads and the full patch table. when the announcement secrets are set, the release is also announced in the project's telegram channel.

## signing and attestation

- **update feeds.** each feed names the release, its build number, the zip url and the sha256 of the zip and of the executable inside it. it's signed with an ed25519 key that only exists as a repository secret, and the signature is verified against `ci/update-public-key.pem` before the release is created. the app has the matching public key built in and refuses a feed that doesn't verify, a download that doesn't match the hashes, and urls outside this repository's releases.
- **debug symbols.** linux and macos releases also carry `tele-<tag>-<platform>-symbols.zip`, the symbol table of the unstripped binary. nobody needs them to run tele; they turn the addresses in a crash dump into function names. windows has none: github's runners run out of disk or memory building them.
- **build provenance.** every zip and the dmg are attested in the job that built them, with github's `actions/attest`. for macos that's the job that joins the arm64 and x86_64 builds into one universal app and signs it. the attestation stays valid when the files are published later from that run. anyone can check a download:

  ```
  gh attestation verify tele-<version>-win64.zip --repo nitreojs/tele
  ```

## new upstream releases

sync.yml checks for a new stable tdesktop release every 3 hours. betas are skipped.

- when the queue applies cleanly, it moves `UPSTREAM`, commits `chore: bump upstream to <tag>`, starts a build with `publish=false` and opens a `new-upstream` issue with the command that publishes that run.
- when it doesn't apply, it opens a `patch-conflict` issue with the log. the conflict is resolved locally, as described in [development](development.md#syncing-with-a-new-upstream-release), and never in ci.

canary.yml applies the queue to upstream's `dev` branch every day and opens a `canary-conflict` issue when it fails, so most conflicts are known before the release that brings them.

a failed or cancelled build on `main` opens a `build-failure` issue. the next announced release closes it.

## ci caches

builds reuse earlier work, without changing what they produce:

- **windows libraries** are kept in the actions cache, keyed by the windows sdk and `prepare.py`.
- **windows and linux objects** are kept with ccache in the actions cache (windows: a pinned ccache release, at most 3 GB per branch; linux: saved from `main`). sources that use `__DATE__` or `__TIME__` are always compiled fresh, so the build date in the app stays right.
- **macos** builds arm64 and x86_64 in parallel and joins them with `lipo`. the files that don't depend on the architecture have to come out identical, so the joined app holds the same files a single universal build makes. the macos libraries and the linux build environment live in ghcr.
